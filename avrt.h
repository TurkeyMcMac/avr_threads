/* GENERAL NOTES
 *
 * Context Switch Interrupts
 * You will have to set up a timer to cause periodic context switch interrupts.
 * When compiling, define AVRT_INTERRUPT to be the symbol to use for the
 * interrupt, e.g. TIMER0_OVF_vect. Because interrupts are used, use cli and sei
 * around sections that need to be atomic.
 *
 * Thread Numbering
 * Only a fixed number of threads is supported. When compiling, define
 * AVRT_MAX_THREADS to a positive number, the maximum number of threads at a
 * time. AVRT_MAX_THREADS must be less than 129. A thread ID is a number between
 * 0 and AVRT_MAX_THREADS - 1, inclusive.
 *
 * Interrupt Safety
 * Unless otherwise noted, these symbols cannot be called/accessed from within
 * interrupts.
